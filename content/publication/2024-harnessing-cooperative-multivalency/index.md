abstract: 'Small‐molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono‐ and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property‐determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6‐thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor‐analyte complexation, achieving ≥97 % identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three classes: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propane, and vicinal diols.'
