              Achieving untargeted chemical identification, isomeric differentiation, and quantification is critical to most scientific and technological problems but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an integrated SERS-based chemical taxonomy machine learning framework for untargeted structural elucidation of 11 epimeric cerebrosides, attaining {\textgreater}90\% accuracy and robust single epimer and multiplex quantification with {\textless}10\% errors. First, we utilize 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid to selectively capture the epimers at molecular sites of isomerism to form epimer-specific SERS fingerprints. Corroborating with
              in-silico
              experiments, we establish five spectral features, each corresponding to a structural characteristic: (1) presence/absence of epimers, (2) monosaccharide/cerebroside, (3) saturated/unsaturated cerebroside, (4) glucosyl/galactosyl, and (5) GlcCer or GalCer's carbon chain lengths. Leveraging these insights, we create a fully generalizable framework to identify and quantify cerebrosides at concentrations between 10−4 to 10−10 M and achieve multiplex quantification of binary mixtures containing biomarkers GlcCer24:1, and GalCer24:1 using their untrained spectra in the models.},
