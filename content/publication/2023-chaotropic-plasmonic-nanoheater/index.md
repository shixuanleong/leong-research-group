abstract: 'Photothermal steam generation promises decentralized water purification, but current methods suffer from slow water evaporation even at high photothermal efficiency of ≈98%. This drawback arises from the high latent heat of vaporization that is required to overcome the strong and extensive hydrogen bonding network in water for steam generation. Here, light‐to‐vapor conversion is boosted by incorporating chaotropic/kosmotropic chemistries onto plasmonic nanoheater to manipulate water intermolecular network at the point‐of‐heating. The chaotropic‐plasmonic nanoheater affords rapid light‐to‐vapor conversion (2.79 kg m−2 h−1 kW−1) at ≈83% efficiency, with the steam generation rate up to 6‐fold better than kosmotropic platforms or emerging photothermal designs.'
