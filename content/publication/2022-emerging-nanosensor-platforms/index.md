abstract: 'Overview of the current status on emerging, multi-faceted nanosensor platform designs and data analysis strategies for rapid, point-of-need detection and monitoring of small-molecule metabolites. Speedy, point-of-need detection and monitoring of small-molecule metabolites are vital across diverse applications ranging from biomedicine to agri-food and environmental surveillance. Nanomaterial-based sensor (nanosensor) platforms are rapidly emerging as excellent candidates for versatile and ultrasensitive detection owing to their highly configurable optical, electrical and electrochemical properties, fast readout, as well as portability and ease of use.'
