abstract: 'Schematic of our bidirectional, ML-empowered approach incorporating plasmonic featurization for rapid (<30 s) and accurate determination of the size and size distribution of gold nanosphere (Au NSs) ensembles in real samples. Determination of nanoparticle size and size distribution is important because these key parameters dictate nanomaterials'' properties and applications. Yet, it is only accomplishable using low-throughput electron microscopy. Herein, we incorporate plasmonic-domain-driven feature engineering with machine learning (ML) for accurate and bidirectional prediction of both parameters for complete characterization of nanoparticle ensembles.'
