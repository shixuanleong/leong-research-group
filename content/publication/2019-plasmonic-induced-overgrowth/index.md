abstract: 'Hybrid materials of earth abundant transition metal dichalcogenides and noble metal nanoparticles, such as molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) and gold nanoparticles, exhibit synergistic effects that can enhance electrocatalytic reactions. However, most current hybrid MoSx-gold synthesis requires an energy intensive heat source of >500 °C or chemical plating to achieve deposition of MoSx on the gold surface. Herein, we demonstrate the direct overgrowth of MoSx over colloidal nanoporous gold (NPG), conducted feasibly under ambient conditions, to form hybrid particles with enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction.'
