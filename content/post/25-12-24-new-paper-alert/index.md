“Computer Vision for High-Throughput Materials Synthesis: A Tutorial for Experimentalists,” has been accepted and published as an Advance Article in Digital Discovery (DOI: 10.1039/D5DD00384A). This work was carried out during Shi Xuan's postdoctoral research, in collaboration with Prof Omar Farha's group! WWe hope this tutorial will serve as a practical guide for materials scientists and chemists seeking to integrate computer vision techniques into their experimental workflows.
